# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 9 March 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to Sethway! Your privacy is our priority. This Privacy Policy outlines the type of information we collect, and how we use it to provide services.

We don't sell data - We don't track you

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

By using Sethway, you are able to sync notifications across your devices. We do not collect, store, or share any of this data.

#### **1.1 No Personal Data Collection**

The notification sync feature - which is the app's primary functionality does not entirely depend on any of our infrastructure to operate.

A peer-to-peer (device-to-device) mechanism is used to sync notification data. This data never reaches us or any external server. This data is only available to you and your connected devices.

#### **1.2 No User Input is Collected**

Any data you manually input into Sethway, whether by picking a QR code image or scanning a QR code, is not collected.

## Sync feature

Although we do not faciliate the relay of notification data for syncing, your device may occasionally connect to our servers to discover it's peers.

## 2. Data Security

We cannot see, modify or change any notification data that is to be synced.

## 3. Crashlytics

We use [Sentry](sentry.io) as our crash reporting provider to help improve the stability of our app. In an event of a crash or an error, certain technical information is collected, which may include:

- Android version
- Device type, model, brand
- Error stack traces and diagnostic data

It does not include any personal information.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or technical requirements. Continued use of Sethway after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
